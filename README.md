# Plan-It: Bring Your Event to Life
Plan-It is an event planning app designed to simplify the process of organizing and managing events. At its MVP stage, it allows users to create, view, update, and delete events. Users can explore and engage with other users' events by viewing event details and communicating their ideas by leaving comments. 

The app aims to evolve into a platform where users can not only manage events but also invite others to join and RSVP. It will facilitate collaboration and social interaction by enabling event organizers to invite participants and track their responses. Additionally, Plan-It will help users discover nearby events that align with their interests, such as beach workouts or other activities open to participation. By bringing events to life, the app aims to enhance event planning experiences and foster community engagement.
